NOTE: This site is still a work in progress. Many of the links are broken, and none of the blog posts are "official" posts. All pages can largely be viewed as tests and placeholders, although the structure/layout of the site is mostly finalized. I intended to wait until I completed the site before pushing it to GitHub, but I need to test the Staticman comments, so, now it's here. I would say this testing period won't last very long, but then I'd probably be a liar. I may take it down again before finally making it offically live. Stay tuned for (hopefully not far off) future updates!

My name is Tad McCorkle. I live in Warner Robins, GA with my wife (and, as of more recently, our puppy) and work as a research engineer for the [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} (GTRI) at their Warner Robins field office. I consider myself more of a software engineer/developer, but I went to school for and work on other things, too. Starting in 2014, I attended [Mercer University](https://www.mercer.edu/){:target="_blank"} in Macon, GA for four and a half years, at which I obtained a Minor in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.mercer.edu/){:target="_blank" title="Mercer Computer Science"}, B.S.E. specializing in [Electrical Engineering](https://engineering.mercer.edu/electrical/){:target="_blank" title="Mercer Electrical Engineering"}, and M.S.E. specializing in [Software Engineering](http://faculty.mercer.edu/macneil_pe/SSEWeb/index.html){:target="_blank" title="Mercer Software Engineering"}. I get to work on [EW systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_warfare){:target="_blank"} now, so the EE degree has turned out to still be pretty relevant to my job. It wasn't until my Junior year of college, though, that the idea of working in Software Engineering occurred to me as a possiblility. During the fall semester of that year I started working as a student intern at GTRI. I was placed with a mobile app development team, and, although I'd taken one or two classes somewhat related to it, that really opened me up to the world of programming. Since then I've tried my hand at a few different [programming languages](), and I'm still trying to learn as much as I can - hopefully my [developer reading list]() keeps growing.

Outside of work, I still like coding on projects in my spare time. I also love [movies](), [music](), [video games](), and [running](). I've got a [growing vinyl collection](), and I'm always [trying to read]() more (I never do as well as I want to though). Since I started commuting for work, I've grown to love [listening to podcasts](), too. My wife and I were also fortunate enough to find a [great church](http://lifeatthehills.com/){:target="_blank"} shortly after moving to Warner Robins, which we currently attend.

## Why make this site?

I'm not sure if I should have a better reason, but I'm mostly making this site for me. I tend to forget my past pretty quickly, and this site obligates me to write about myself. I guess if I were to listify why I decided to make it, it'd go something like:

* I can use it as a reference if I forget something I previously knew.
* It gives me a way to share, both with others and future me, what I'm learning, thinking, and doing.
* I want to learn more about web development, and a static site seemed like a decent starting point.
* I can use it as a professional portfolio.

Thanks again for checking out my site, and don't hesitate to [get in touch]({{ site.contact }}){:title="Contact Me"}. Please also click some of the links above or below to see more of what I've been doing.
