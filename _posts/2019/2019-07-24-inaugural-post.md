I've been working on this site for a good while now. I intended to quickly throw together a static site with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} so I could start writing about things I was learning in programming, but, because I also made the decision to design the site from scratch, I immediately got caught up in all the nonessentials (color scheme, font choice, comment section, [email list](/blog/subscribe), animations, pagination, etc.), which I should have been writing about as I was doing them.

I could continue redesigning this site until I think it's perfect, but I've decided to settle for good enough and to start using this site for the reason I originally set out to make it. This post marks the "official" launch of this site.
